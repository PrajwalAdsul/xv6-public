# xv6
I have changed syscall.h syscall.c usys.S user.h sysfile.c
The code for lseek is in sysfile.c
test1.c and test2.c are the testing programs added

To run,
rum command 'make qemu'
there will be two executables created test1 and test2
test1 is executable for first test program in assignment
test2 is executable for second test program in assignment
